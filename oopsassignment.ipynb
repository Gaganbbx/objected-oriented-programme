    "##The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    " ##   Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the concept of hiding the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world and exposing only what is necessary through a public interface. Encapsulation helps in protecting the object from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    " ##   Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the concept of representing complex real-world systems in simplified and generalized terms using abstract classes, interfaces, and methods. Abstraction helps in managing the complexity of large software systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    " ##   Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors. Inheritance helps in creating a hierarchy of classes that share common properties and behaviors, thus promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ##  Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class, allowing them to be used interchangeably. Polymorphism helps in creating flexible and extensible code that can work with different types of objects without needing to know their exact type."
